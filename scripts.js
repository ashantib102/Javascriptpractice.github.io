/*THE CONSOLE- Displays messages like errors. Console is an object, which is a collection of data and actions
CONSOLE.LOG()- A method on the console object used to log or print messages to the console. 

console.log(5); Prints 5 to the console 
NOTE: Javascript code will run as intended without a semicolon at the end but it is a best practice to include it.

DATA TYPES 

    Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.

    BigInt: Any number, greater than 2^53-1 or less than -(2^53-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.

    String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ", though we prefer single quotes. 

    Boolean: This data type only has two possible valuesâ€” either true or false (without quotes).

    Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).

    Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null. undefined means that a given value does not exist.

    Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.

    Object: Collections of related data.

    All data types have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance. 
    Ex: Strings have length property
    console.log('Hello'.length); Prints 5

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS- Perform tasks in code

    console.log(3 + 4); Prints 7
    console.log(5 - 1); Prints 4
    console.log(4 * 2); Prints 8
    console.log(9 / 3); Prints 3
    console.log(11 % 3); Prints the remainder 2

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS- Assign value to left operand based on value of its right operand
    += addition assignment
    -= subtraction assignment
    *= multiplication assignment
    /= division assignment

    let number=28;

    number= number*10;
    number*=10;
    console.log(number); Prints 280

VARIABLES- Containers for data

    Variable Declarations
    var height;   var was used in prior versions of Javascript(pre-ES6).
    let age;      Contains undefined if nothing is assigned to it. Allows you to change the value of the variable later on.
    const name= 'Ashanti';   Used for variables with values that will remain constant.


    Initalizing Variables
    let age;          Can declare without initalizing
    console.log(age); Prints: undefined
    age=15;
    console.log(age); Print: 15

    const name="Ashanti";
    name="Sidney"  //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

STRINGS

    let age= 9;

    CONCATENATION: 'Mark is  ' + age + ' years old.';
    INTERPOLATION: 'Mark is  ${age} years old.';

METHODS- Data types have access to methods that allow us to handle instances of that data type.

    console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); Prints 'HELLO'
    console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); Prints true
    More methods at the documentation website : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

BUILT IN OBJECTS

    Math object is used for complex operations
    console.log(Math.random()); Prints a random DECIMAL number between 0 and 1

    To generate a DECIMAL number between 1 and 10 use:
    Math.random() *10;

    To make the result a whole number we use Math.floor(). It takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. 

    Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);


    A LITTLE REVIEW: 
    Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().

    Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879

    Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'

    The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.

    Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.

    Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().

    We can access properties and methods by using the . dot operator.

    Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.

CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

IF...else statement structure
let sale= false;
if(sale == true){
    console.log("Time to buy!");
}
else{
    console.log("Wait for a sale")
}   

COMPARISON OPERATORS
Less than: <
Greater than: >
Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=
Is equal to: ===
Is not equal to: !==

'apples' === 'oranges' will evaluate to false

The else statement must be paired with an if statement.

//DOM = DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
/*
Object{} that represents the page you see in the web browser and provides you with an API to interact with it. 
Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads the HTML document, and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation.
Javascript can access the DOM to dynamically change the content, structure and style of a web page.

Explanation: https://youtu.be/NO5kUNxGIu0?si=t1MUM8eL1LPf4L_I

Element Selectors= Methods used to target and manipulate HTML elements. They allow you to select one or multiple HTML 
elements from the DOM(Document Object Model).

1. document.getElementById() //Element or Null
2. document.getElementsClassName() 
3. document.getElementsByTagName()
